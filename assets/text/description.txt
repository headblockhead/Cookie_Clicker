Crisps!

A free-to-play game with NO ads, NO in-app purchases and NONE of any sort of trickery you might find in other games.

In this game, the only goal is to have the MOST Crisps at one point. Every time you press the big button labeled "CRISPS!" you get 1 or more crisps.
To aid you in your quest, you can hire robots to make crisps for you so you don't have to do the hard work of pressing the button.
